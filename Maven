Maven is an open-source build automation and project management tool widely used for Java applications.
It is based on POM (Project object Model)
As a build automation tool, it automates the source code compilation and dependency management, assembles binary codes into packages, and executes test scripts.

Maven Coordinates:
GMaven coordinates are a set of identifiers that uniquely identify a project, dependency, or plugin in a Maven POM file. They are a combination of the following values:
groupId: The group, company, or department responsible for creating the project
artifactId: A unique name for the project under the groupId
version: Specifies a particular release of the project

Maven Goals:
Build life cycle is of three types:
default
clean
site

clean: remove all files generated by the previous build
compile: compile the source code of the project
test: run tests using a suitable unit testing framework
package: take the complied code and package it into a distributable format such as jar
install: install the package into local repo in mvn i.e. ".m2"
deploy: copies the final package to the remote repo
