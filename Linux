LINUX INTRO:
Linux is a Kernal and Open-source UNIX like OS.

LINUX COMMANDS:
------------------File and Directory Operations Commands-----------------------:

ls ->List files and directories
ls -ltrh -> Detailed info of thr file with time and human redable format
ls -a -> shows the hidden files
ls -i -> To check the inode value
cd ->change Directory, cd <dirname/>
pwd ->Print corrent working directory
mkdir ->create new directory, mkdir <dirname>
rm -> Remove file and directory, rm -rf <filename> {remove,force removal}
cp ->Copy files and directorie, cp <file1> <file2>
mv -> Move files and directorie, mv <source> <Destination> 
e.g. mv file1 file2 file3 newdir
touch -> Create an empty file, touch <filename>
cat -> View the contents of the file, cat <filename>
vi -> Is to edit the content of the file, vi <filename>, click on I (insert), write someting, :wq
man -> It is short term for manual page, man ls -> It will list down all the information about ls command.

------------------------Linux Dir/File structure----------------------------------:
/root -> for root user, root user can only create, del, modify anything
/home -> This is for spacific user, no other user can manipulate naything in this. e.g. /home/bulbul
/bin (binaries) -> all the commands for all the user are available here
/sbin (system binaries) -> commands available only for root users, used for performing major changes in the config file, or any system changes
/proc (process) -> all the applications process file is getting stored here
/boot (Boot loader file)
/dev (Device files) -> Interface between the hardware and software (hardware info and software info)
/media
/etc (editable text configuration) -> all the config files of the application is getting stored here
/srv (service data) 
/sys (System) -> hardware related info is getting stored here
/lib (system libraries) -> libraries required to run the application
/tmp (temporary files) 
/usr (user program)
/var (variable files) -> cache,logs,email files,backup files,spool
/opt (optional application) -> third party tool 

-----------------------File Permission Commands----------------------------------:

u: User/owner permissions.
g: Group permissions.
o: Other permissions.
+: Add permissions.
–: Remove permissions.
=: Set permissions explicitly.
r: Read Permission ->4
w: Write Permission ->2
x: Execute Permission ->1

chmod ->Change file permissions.
e.g. chmod +rwx Filename
     chmod 774 (user,group,other) Filename
     chmod 664 Filename
    
chown -> Change File owner.
e.g. chown <New owner> Filename

chgrp ->Change group ownership.
e.g. chgrp <New group> Filename

------------------------Private and Public ip's----------------------:

Private ip: hostname -i
Public ip: curl ifconfig.me

------------------------Memory and Harddisk--------------------------:

Primary Memory -> free -m
Display all the processes -> ps-ef
Secondary memory -> df -h
cpu -> top
directory -> du

------------------------Hard Link & Soft Link------------------------:

Soft Link: It stores the path of the File and works as a shortcut to the file.
           If original file is moved/deleted the soft link gets deleted and the link will point to a non-existent file..
           Inode value of both original file and soft link is different.
           Soft link can be linked to a directory.

ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 

Hard Link: If original file is moved/deleted the hard link will still show the content of the file.
           Inode value of both original file and hard link is same.
           Hard link cannot be created for a directory to avoid recursive loops.

ln  [original filename] [link name]

------------------------Find, Sort and Grep------------------------:

Grep -> stands for Global Regular Expression Print
        To search text or strings in a file 
     -v    ║ Shows all the lines except the searched one    ║ 
     -c    ║ Displays only the count of matching lines      ║ 
     -n    ║ Shows the matching line and its number.        ║ 
     -i    ║ Match both (upper and lower) case.             ║ 
     -l    shows just the name of the file with the string║
e.g. Grep -i word <filename>


Find -> Search the path of file or Directory
e.g. find <path of file>, find /home/dir1/file1
     find . -name <filename> -> To search in present directory
     find / -name <filename> -> To search in entire filesystem

Sort -> It arranges the data aplabetically or numerically in asc/desc order.
e.g. sort <filename>

----------------------wget,scp, curl ---------------------------------:
 wget: To get the package from Internet
 e.g. wget <link address>

scp (secure copy protocol) : It lets you share files and data securely and easily. SCP uses encryption over an SSH (Secure Shell) connection, this ensures that the data being transferred is protected from suspicious attacks.
We are able to use SCP in the following cases:
Copy files within same machine.
Copy files from a local host to remote host and vice versa.
Copy files between two different remote servers.

Pre-requisite for using scp:
SSh installed on both the client and the server machines.
Root access to both client and server machines.

Curl: Used to fetch data/content from the url , or uploading files to the server/downloading files from the Internet
e.g. curl https://www.geeksforgeeks.org
e.g. curl -T uploadfile.txt ftp://example.com/upload/
e.g. curl -o [file_name] [URL...]

----------------------tar,zar,unzip -----------------------------------:

 tar -cvf <tar_file_name> <file_name> ->compressing file to tar format
 tar -xvf <tar_file_name> -> extracting / decompressing file

 Zip: To compress files to reduce file size

 zip <filename.zip> <file1.txt> <file2.txt> -> storing file1.txt & file2.txt under file.zip folder
 zip -u <filename.zip> <file3.txt> -> -u means we can add more files into file.zip folder.
 zip -r [file_name.zip] [directory_name] -> Zip all the files present in directory/sub-dir

 unzip <filename.zip>

-----------------------SSH (Secure shell)---------------------------------:

Provides secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network.

Master m/c:
ssh-keygen
cd /root/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub
cd
ssh <public_ip_host machine>

Host m/c:
cd /root/.ssh
vi authorized_keys <paste the public key>
To see public ip of host machine: curl ifconfig.me

--------------------------sed and awk command--------------------------------:
