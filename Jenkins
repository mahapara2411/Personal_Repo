 By default, Jenkins stores all of its data in this directory in the file system
  - /var/lib/jenkins

Build Triggers in Jenkins:
  - Trigger builds remotely (e.g. from scripts)
      - Trigger new builds by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts)
      - This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous users.
  - Build after other projects are built
      - Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project.
      - convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete
  - Build periodically
      - Provides a cron -like feature to periodically execute this project.
      - Not ideal for continuously building software projects
      - 
  - GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
      - 
  - Poll SCM
      - Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM.
      - expensive operation for CVS, as every polling requires Jenkins to scan the entire workspace and verify it with the server
