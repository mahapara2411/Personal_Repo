-------------IAM : Identity and Access Management--------------
 - Provides authentication and authorization
 - Users: User can belong to multiple groups. (attach the policies to the users). "IAMuserChangepassword"
 - Groups : Groups are collections of "users" and have "policies" attached to them.
   - IAM User has limited permission to the account.
 - Policies: Policies are JSON documents that outline permissions for users, groups or roles
     1. User based policies
       - IAM policies define which API calls should be allowed for a specific user.
     2. Resource based policies
       - Control access to an AWS resource.
 - Roles: Collection of policies for AWS services.

--------------EC2 (ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE)-----------------------

- It is a Virtual server

- Types of EC2 Instances:
- General Purpose
   - Provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources
   - Ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.
   - consists of M and T family Instances
- Compute optimized
   - Ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.
   - High performance computing (HPC), batch processing, ad serving, video encoding, gaming, scientific modelling, distributed analytics, and CPU-based machine learning inference.
   - Consists of C Family Instances
- Memory optimized
   - deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
   - Consists of R, X and U Family Instances
- Storage optimized
   - designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage
   - Consists of I,D and H family Instances
- Accelerated computing
   - use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
   - Consists of P,G,T,I,D,F,V Family Instances

- Instance States:
   - Stop
   - Start
   - Terminate
   - Hybernate
   - Standby

- Steps Involved in Launcing an Instance:
  - Name/Tags
  - AMI (Linux,Ubuntu,macos,Redhat etc..)
  - Instance type (e.g. t2 micro)
  - Key pair Login
  - Network settings
    - VPC
    - Subnet
    - Security groups
  - Configure storage (e.g. gp2,gp3 etc..)
  - Launch Instance

- Steps to change the Instance type:
  - Stop the Instance
  - Actions ->Instance settings ->Change Instance type ->Select New Instance type ->Apply

- Regions and availability zone

---------------AMI (Amazon Machine Images)---------------------
- AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance

--------------VPC (VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD)----------------------
- Size of VPC can be defined by using IP address range
- subnet -> Splitting the IP address of the VPC
- Inside VPC - Internet gateway - Public subnet- Elastic Load balancer (ELB) (Sends the request to private subnet) - Router Table - Security group - Private subnet
- NACL - 
- NAT Gateway - Helps to download resource from Internet and masks the IP address. It is cretaed in the Public subnet
- SNAT -
