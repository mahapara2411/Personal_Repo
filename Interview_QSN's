--------: LINUX :-------------
1. Application port is running or not ?
 - command using 'netstat -lntpu'
 - ex- tomcat 8080,nginx 80

2. Memory Check                                                       
 - "TOP" Able to see the CPU Usages: 
 - "free -h" primary memory RAM Usages:
 - "df -h" secondary memory HDD Usages: 
 - "du" directory memory check:
 - uptime: Load Average: 

3. SOFT LINK VS HARD LINK & INODE IN LINUX:
 - Soft Link: It stores the path of the File and works as a shortcut to the file.
           ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 

 - Hard Link: Points directly to the inode of another file
           ln  [original filename] [link name]

  - An inode stores metadata for each file and directory in the file system, 
     such as (File type, File size, Owner ID, Group ID, Read, write and execute permissions)

4. cron-job ?
 - to run the script in a particular interval. 
Ex:
 - * * * * *: the job runs every minute
 - * 0 1 1 1: the job runs every minute of the midnight hour on January 1st and Mondays.

5. What is AWK & SED command
sed -> stream editor that allows users to perform basic text transformations. Insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution).
e.g unix is great os. 
$sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
-- above statement will be replaced by linux is great os. 
e.g. 2: $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt -> Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line 
e.g. 3: $sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt -> Replacing all the occurance of the line

awk -> Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing of text file-in particular data files that are organized by rows and columns
e.g $ awk '{print}' employee.txt
$ awk '{print, $2}' employee.txt ----> to print the second column
NR -> Display field number
NF -> Display last field

6. Directory structure in linux
/root -> for root user, root user can only create, del, modify anything
/home -> This is for specific user, no other user can manipulate anything in this. e.g. /home/bulbul
/bin (binaries) -> all the commands for all the user are available here
/sbin (system binaries) -> commands available only for root users, used for performing major changes in the config file, or any system changes
/dev (Device files) -> Interface between the hardware and software (hardware info and software info)
/media
/etc (editable text configuration) -> all the config files of the application is getting stored here
/sys (System) -> hardware related info is getting stored here
/lib (system libraries) -> libraries required to run the application
/tmp (temporary files) 
/usr (user program)
/var (variable files) -> cache,logs,email files,backup files,spool
/opt (optional application) -> third party tool 

7. Daily/10 cmds in linux
 - ls 
 - ls -ltrh 
 - cd <dirname/>
 - rm -rf <filename> 
 - cat <filename>
 - vi <filename>
 - free -h
 - df -h
 - Grep -i word <filename>
 - find / -name <filename> 

8. How to check public IP, Private IP & Linux system version
 - Private ip: hostname -i
 - Public ip: curl ifconfig.me
 - To see the current ip address on linux: ifconfig
 - Linux OS Version: cat /etc/os-release (or) hostnamectl (or) cat /etc/*release (or) cat /etc/*version 
 - Linux Kernel version: uname -a

9. How to search file's in linux? use of Find & GREP cmd
- Grep -> To search text or strings in a file 
  e.g. Grep -i word <filename>
- Find -> Search the path of file or Directory
  e.g. find <path of file>, find /home/dir1/file1
     find . -name <filename> -> To search in present directory
     find / -name <filename> -> To search in entire filesystem
     find . -name *.war -> To search a file

10. File permission & examples 
chmod -> Change file permissions.
e.g. chmod +rwx Filename
     chmod 774 (user,group,other) Filename
     chmod 664 Filename
    
chown -> Change File owner.
e.g. chown <New owner> Filename

chgrp -> Change group ownership.
e.g. chgrp <New group> Filename

11. How to see if a linux service is running?
- redhat/fedora/centos/amazon linux : systemctl status <service-name>
- ubuntu : service <service-name> status
PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
- redhat/fedora/centos/amazon linux : yum install git -y
- ubuntu : apt-get install git -y

12. What is SSH and how it is used?
- secure shell, used for secure remote access
