--------: LINUX :-------------
1. Application port is running or not ?
 - command using 'netstat -lntpu'
 - ex- tomcat 8080,nginx 80

2. Memory Check                                                       
 - "TOP" Able to see the CPU Usages 
 - "free -h" primary memory RAM Usages
 - "df -h" secondary memory HDD Usages
 - "du" directory memory check. 
 - uptime: Load Average

3. SOFT LINK VS HARD LINK & INODE IN LINUX:
Soft Link: It stores the path of the File and works as a shortcut to the file.
           If original file is moved/deleted the soft link gets deleted and the link will point to a non-existent file..
           Inode value of both original file and soft link is different.
           Soft link can be linked to a directory.

ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 

Hard Link: If original file is moved/deleted the hard link will still show the content of the file.
           Inode value of both original file and hard link is same.
           Hard link cannot be created for a directory to avoid recursive loops.

ln  [original filename] [link name]

An inode, or index node, is a file-based data structure in Linux that stores metadata for each file and directory in the file system. 
Inodes are essential for the operating system to function properly.
Inodes store metadata such as:
File type
File size
Owner ID
Group ID
Read, write and execute permissions

4. cron-job ?
 - to run the script in a particular interval. 
|------------------------------- Minute (0-59)
|     |------------------------- Hour (0-23)
|     |     |------------------- Day of the month (1-31)
|     |     |     |------------- Month (1-12; or JAN to DEC)
|     |     |     |     |------- Day of the week (0-6; or SUN to SAT; or 7 for Sunday)
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
*     *     *     *     *

Ex:
 - * * * * *: the job runs every minute
 - * 0 1 1 1: the job runs every minute of the midnight hour on January 1st and Mondays.

5. What is AWK & SED command
sed -> stream editor that allows users to perform basic text transformations. Insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution).
e.g unix is great os. 
$sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
-- above statement will be replaced by linux is great os. 
e.g. 2: $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt -> Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line 
e.g. 3: $sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt -> Replacing all the occurance of the line

awk -> Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing of text file-in particular data files that are organized by rows and columns
e.g $ awk '{print}' employee.txt
$ awk '{print, $2}' employee.txt ----> to print the second column
NR -> Display field number
NF -> Display last field

6. Directory structure in linux
/root -> for root user, root user can only create, del, modify anything
/home -> This is for specific user, no other user can manipulate anything in this. e.g. /home/bulbul
/bin (binaries) -> all the commands for all the user are available here
/sbin (system binaries) -> commands available only for root users, used for performing major changes in the config file, or any system changes
/dev (Device files) -> Interface between the hardware and software (hardware info and software info)
/media
/etc (editable text configuration) -> all the config files of the application is getting stored here
/sys (System) -> hardware related info is getting stored here
/lib (system libraries) -> libraries required to run the application
/tmp (temporary files) 
/usr (user program)
/var (variable files) -> cache,logs,email files,backup files,spool
/opt (optional application) -> third party tool 

7. Daily/10 cmds in linux
 - ls 
 - ls -ltrh 
 - cd <dirname/>
 - rm -rf <filename> 
 - cat <filename>
 - vi <filename>
 - free -h
 - df -h
 - Grep -i word <filename>
 - find / -name <filename> 

8. How to check public IP, Private IP & Linux system version
Private ip: hostname -i
Public ip: curl ifconfig.me
Linux OS Version: cat /etc/os-release (or) hostnamectl (or) cat /etc/*release (or) cat /etc/*version 

9. How to search file's in linux? use of Find & GREP cmd
Grep -> stands for Global Regular Expression Print
        To search text or strings in a file 
     -v    ║ Shows all the lines except the searched one    ║ 
     -c    ║ Displays only the count of matching lines      ║ 
     -n    ║ Shows the matching line and its number.        ║ 
     -i    ║ Match both (upper and lower) case.             ║ 
     -l    shows just the name of the file with the string║
e.g. Grep -i word <filename>


Find -> Search the path of file or Directory
e.g. find <path of file>, find /home/dir1/file1
     find . -name <filename> -> To search in present directory
     find / -name <filename> -> To search in entire filesystem
     find . -name *.war -> To search a file

10. File permission & examples 
u: User/owner permissions.
g: Group permissions.
o: Other permissions.
+: Add permissions.
–: Remove permissions.
=: Set permissions explicitly.
r: Read Permission ->4
w: Write Permission ->2
x: Execute Permission ->1

chmod -> Change file permissions.
e.g. chmod +rwx Filename
     chmod 774 (user,group,other) Filename
     chmod 664 Filename
    
chown -> Change File owner.
e.g. chown <New owner> Filename

chgrp -> Change group ownership.
e.g. chgrp <New group> Filename
