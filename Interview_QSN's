--------: LINUX :-------------
1. Application port is running or not ?
 - command using 'netstat -lntpu'
 - ex- tomcat 8080,nginx 80

2. Memory Check                                                       
 - "TOP" Able to see the CPU Usages: 
 - "free -h" primary memory RAM Usages:
 - "df -h" secondary memory HDD Usages: 
 - "du" directory memory check:
 - uptime: Load Average: 

3. SOFT LINK VS HARD LINK & INODE IN LINUX:
 - Soft Link: It stores the path of the File and works as a shortcut to the file.
           ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 

 - Hard Link: Points directly to the inode of another file
           ln  [original filename] [link name]

 - An inode stores metadata for each file and directory in the file system, 
     such as (File type, File size, Owner ID, Group ID, Read, write and execute permissions)

4. cron-job ?
 - to run the script in a particular interval. 
Ex:
 - * * * * *: the job runs every minute
 - * 0 1 1 1: the job runs every minute of the midnight hour on January 1st and Mondays.

5. What is AWK & SED command
sed -> stream editor that allows users to perform basic text transformations. Insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution).
e.g unix is great os. 
$sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
-- above statement will be replaced by linux is great os. 
e.g. 2: $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt -> Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line 
e.g. 3: $sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt -> Replacing all the occurance of the line

awk -> Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing of text file-in particular data files that are organized by rows and columns
e.g $ awk '{print}' employee.txt
$ awk '{print, $2}' employee.txt ----> to print the second column
NR -> Display field number
NF -> Display last field

6. Directory structure in linux
/root -> for root user, root user can only create, del, modify anything
/home -> This is for specific user, no other user can manipulate anything in this. e.g. /home/bulbul
/bin (binaries) -> all the commands for all the user are available here
/sbin (system binaries) -> commands available only for root users, used for performing major changes in the config file, or any system changes
/dev (Device files) -> Interface between the hardware and software (hardware info and software info)
/media
/etc (editable text configuration) -> all the config files of the application is getting stored here
/sys (System) -> hardware related info is getting stored here
/lib (system libraries) -> libraries required to run the application
/tmp (temporary files) 
/usr (user program)
/var (variable files) -> cache,logs,email files,backup files,spool
/opt (optional application) -> third party tool 

7. Daily/10 cmds in linux
 - ls 
 - ls -ltrh 
 - cd <dirname/>
 - rm -rf <filename> 
 - cat <filename>
 - vi <filename>
 - free -h
 - df -h
 - Grep -i word <filename>
 - find / -name <filename> 

8. How to check public IP, Private IP & Linux system version
 - Private ip: hostname -i
 - Public ip: curl ifconfig.me
 - To see the current ip address on linux: ifconfig
 - Linux OS Version: cat /etc/os-release (or) hostnamectl (or) cat /etc/*release (or) cat /etc/*version 
 - Linux Kernel version: uname -a

9. How to search file's in linux? use of Find & GREP cmd
- Grep -> To search text or strings in a file 
  e.g. Grep -i word <filename>
- Find -> Search the path of file or Directory
  e.g. find <path of file>, find /home/dir1/file1
     find . -name <filename> -> To search in present directory
     find / -name <filename> -> To search in entire filesystem
     find . -name *.war -> To search a file

10. File permission & examples 
chmod -> Change file permissions.
e.g. chmod +rwx Filename
     chmod 774 (user,group,other) Filename
     chmod 664 Filename
    
chown -> Change File owner.
e.g. chown <New owner> Filename

chgrp -> Change group ownership.
e.g. chgrp <New group> Filename

11. How to see if a linux service is running?
- redhat/fedora/centos/amazon linux : systemctl status <service-name>
- ubuntu : service <service-name> status
PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
- redhat/fedora/centos/amazon linux : yum install git -y
- ubuntu : apt-get install git -y

12. What is SSH and how it is used?
- secure shell, used for secure remote access
- provides encrypted communication between client and server

13. 
=============================: GIT :=============================================
1. What is Git stash?
 - We create multiple branches to work simultaneously on multiple features. But to work on multiple tasks simultaneously in one branch (i.e. on one feature), we use git stash. Stash is a temporary repository where we can store our content and bring it back whenever we want to continue with our work with that stored content.
 - It removes content inside file from working directory and puts in stashing store and gives clean working directory so that we can start new work freshly.
 - Later on you can bring back that stashed items to working directory and can resume your work on that file. Git stash applicable to modified files. Not new files. Once we finish our work, we can remove all stashed items form stash repository.

2. What is Git Reset?
 - Git Reset command is used to remove changes form staging area. This is bringing back file form staging area to work directory. We use this command before commit. Often we go with git add accidentally. In this case if we commit, that file will be committed. Once you commit, commit ID will be generated and it will be in the knowledge of everyone. So to avoid this one, we use Git reset.
 - If you add “–hard” flag to git reset command, in one go, file will be removed from staging area as well as working directory. We generally go with this one if we fell that something wrong in the file itself.

3. What is Git Revert?
 - Git Revert command is used to remove changes from all 3 stages (work directory, staging area and local repository). We use this command after commit. Sometimes, we commit accidentally and later on we realize that we shouldn’t have done that. For this we use Git revert. This operation will generate new commit ID with some meaningful message to ignore previous commit where mistake is there. But, here we can’t completely eliminate the commit where mistake is there. Because Git tracks each and every change.

4. Difference between Git pull and Git clone?
 - We use these two commands to get changes from central repository. For the first time if you want whole central repository in your local server, we use git clone. 
 - It brings entire repository to your local server. Next time onwards you might want only changes instead of whole repository. In this case, we use Git pull.
 - Git clone is to get whole copy of central repository
 - Git pull is to get only new changes from central repository (Incremental data)

5. What is the difference between Git pull and Fetch?
 - We use Git pull command to get changes from central repository. In this operation, internally two commands will get executed. One is Git fetch and another one is Git merge.
 - So Git pull is the combination of {Git pull & Git merge}.
 - Git fetch means, only bringing changes from central repo to local repo. But these changes will not be integrated to local repo which is there in your server.
 - Git merge means, merging changes to your local repository which is there in your server. Then only you can see these changes.
 
6. What is the difference between Git merge and rebase?
 - We often use these commands to merge code in multiple branches. Both are almost same but few differences. When you run Git merge, one new merge commit will be generated which is having the history of both development branches. 
 - It preserves the history of both branches. By seeing this merge commit, everyone will come to know that we merged two branches. 
 - If you do Git rebase, commits in new branch will be applied on top of base branch tip. 
 - There won’t be any merge commit here. It appears that you started working in one single branch form the beginning. 
 - This operation will not preserves the history of new branch.

7. What is Git Bisect?
 - Git Bisect we use to pick bad commit out of all good commits. 
 - Often developers do some mistakes. For them it is very difficult to pick that commit where mistake is there.
 - They go with building all commits one by one to pick bad commit. But Git bisect made their lives easy. Git bisect divides all commits equally in to two parts (bisecting equally). Now instead of building each commit, they go with building both parts. Where ever bad commit is there, that part build will be failed. We do operation many times till we get bad commit. So Git bisect allows you to find a bad commit out of good commits. You don’t have to trace down the bad commit by hand; git-bisect will do that for you.

8. What is Git squash?
 - To move multiple commits into its parent so that you end up with one commit. If you repeat this process multiple times, you can reduce “n” number of commits to a single one. Finally we will end up with only one parent commit. We use this operation just to reduce number of commits.
 - git rebase -i 3

10. What is Git cherry-pick?
 - When you go with git merge, all commits which are there in new development branch will be merged into current branch where you are. 
 - But sometimes, requirement will be in such that you would want to get only one commit form development branch instead of merging all commits. 
 - In this case we go with git cherry-pick. Git cherry-pick will pick only one commit whatever you select and merges with commits which are there in your current branch. 
 - So picking particular commit and merging into your current branch we call git cherry-pick.
