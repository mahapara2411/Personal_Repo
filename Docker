- It's a software platform that allows to build, test, and deploy applications quickly
- An operating system for containers
- Containerize any application

- Docker Architecture:
  - Docker Deamon: 
    - The daemon (dockerd) is a process which runs in the background and waits for Client's command.
    - It is capable of managing various docker objects.
  - Docker Client:
    - The client (docker) is a CLI program responsible for transporting commands issued by users.
  - Rest API:
    - Bridge between the daemon and the client. 
    - Any command issued using the client passes through the API to finally reach the daemon.

- Docker Image:
  - Template for creating an env of choice
  - Snapshot
  - Has everything need to run an app
  - OS, App Code, software

- Docker Registeries:
  - Highly scalable server side appln that stores and distributes the docker images
  - Used in CI/CD pipeline
  - Runs the application

- Containers:
  - Running Instance of an Image

- Docker volumes:
  - Allow sharing of date (files,folders)
  - Between host and container
    - <Folder> pwd
    - <Folder> docker run --name <container_name> -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
    - <Folder> docker exec -it <container_name> bash -> Inside the container
    - ls -la
  - Between containers

- Docker Commands:
  - docker --version
  - docker ps -> To check the running containers
  - docker ps -a -> containers that are currently running or have run in the past
  - docker pull <nginx>
  - docker images -> Lists down the available Images
  - docker run nginx:latest -> To run containers
  - docker run -d nginx:latest -> To run containers in detached mode
  - docker container ls -> To list the running containers
  - docker stop <Container_id/ Container_name> -> To stop the running container
  - docker start <Container_id/ Container_name>
  - docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx:latest -> To expose external port, Map local host 8080 to port 80 inside of the container
  - docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 3000:80 nginx:latest -> To expose multiple ports
  - docker rm <Container_id/ Container_name> / docker rm  -f <Container_id/ Container_name> -> To remove the container / To remove the container forcefully
  - docker ps -aq -> To retrieve every single container id
  - docker rm $(docker ps -aq) -> To remove every single container
  - docker run --name <website> -d -p 8080:80 -p 3000:80 nginx:latest -> To name the container as "website"
